<p class="question">What is this?</p><p class="anwser">SBX Headset is a way for everyone to get customised feeds from FB Groups like "Free Expressions Group" via the intranet. You can view every post on the group, or (if you want to) only posts on topics you like.</p><p class="question">Does it consume my data?</p><p class="anwser">No. It's all over the Intranet so does not consume any data. The only data needed is for us to download everything once to our database.</p><p class="question">Does it access posts from Shoutboxx?</p><p class="anwser">No. Right now, it only covers "Free Expression Group". For running the
tool on a given group, we need admin access to that group. The only way we can add Shoutboxx or any other group is if one of the admins adds us. (We promise to be nice)</p><p class="question">How do I use this
?</p><p class="anwser">You need to register and login first. Once you have done so, you can decide to view a feed of selected topics (by using tags) or see all posts ("See all posts" button at the bottom).</p><p class="question">What are tags?</p><p class="anwser">Tags are basically the topics on which you want to see posts on. So if you want to see all posts of club inductions and Pearl, you add the tags"inductions" and "Pearl". That way, you get to see a feed of all the posts you want to see. You can also select any of the commonly used tags ("Common tags" button at the bottom).</p><p class="question">What else can this do?</p><p class="anwser">All your preferred tags are stored so you can login again to see new posts (this updates every 10 minutes). For viewing a post on FB, just follow the link here. Right now that's mostly it, but more functionality can be added on demand. Do let us know how it is!
